# System Design

System design is a crucial aspect of software engineering, especially for larger scale applications. Here are key topics to study:

## Scalability
- [ ] Vertical scaling
- [ ] Horizontal scaling
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Load balancing
- [ ] Database replication
- [ ] Database partitioning

## System Design Basics
- [ ] Client-Server model
- [ ] Network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS)
- [ ] Storage systems (SQL vs NoSQL, choosing the right database)
- [ ] Caching systems (Memcached, Redis)
- [ ] Messaging systems and queues

## Distributed Systems
- [ ] CAP theorem
- [ ] Consistency patterns
- [ ] Availability patterns
- [ ] Partition tolerance

## Microservices Architecture
- [ ] Service oriented architecture
- [ ] Microservices vs Monolithic architecture
- [ ] API gateway
- [ ] Service discovery

## Cloud Computing
- [ ] IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- [ ] Virtualization and Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- [ ] Serverless architecture

## Security
- [ ] Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] HTTPS and TLS
- [ ] Firewalls and security groups

## Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Health checks
- [ ] Log aggregation
- [ ] Metrics and alerting

## Case Studies
Practice designing these systems:
- [ ] URL shortener
- [ ] Social media feed
- [ ] File sharing service
- [ ] Video streaming platform
- [ ] Chat application

## Resources
- [ ] "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
- [ ] System Design Primer (GitHub repository)
- [ ] Grokking the System Design Interview (course)

Remember, system design is about trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution, but rather the best solution given the constraints and requirements. Practice explaining your design decisions and their implications.
