# How to Use This Study Plan

## 1. Fork the repository

Start by forking the GitHub repository. This allows you to track your progress and make changes without affecting the original.

## 2. Create a new branch

Create a new branch called `progress` to track your advancements:

bash
git checkout -b progress

## 3. Use the task lists

The study plan uses GitHub's task list feature. As you complete each item, mark it as done by putting an 'x' in the brackets:

- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [x] Completed task

## 4. Follow the order

Work through the topics in the order they're presented. The plan is structured to build your knowledge progressively.

## 5. Watch the videos and read the articles

For each topic, watch the suggested videos and read the linked articles. Take notes to reinforce your learning.

## 6. Implement the data structures and algorithms

Don't just read about data structures and algorithms - implement them! This hands-on practice is crucial for understanding.

## 7. Solve coding problems

Regularly solve coding problems related to the topics you're studying. Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal are great for this.

## 8. Review and revisit

Periodically review topics you've already covered. Spaced repetition helps reinforce your learning.

## 9. Track your progress

Regularly commit your progress to your GitHub fork:
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed [topic]"
git push origin progress


## 10. Adapt as needed

While it's recommended to follow the plan, feel free to adapt it to your needs and learning style.

## 11. Join a study group

Consider finding a study buddy or joining a study group. Explaining concepts to others and discussing problems can deepen your understanding.

## 12. Take breaks

Learning can be intense. Remember to take regular breaks to avoid burnout and allow your brain to process information.

Remember, the goal is not just to check off items, but to truly understand the concepts. Take your time, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into topics that interest you or that you find challenging.
