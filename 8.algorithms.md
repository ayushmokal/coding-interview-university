For each algorithm:
1. Understand the problem it solves
2. Learn the algorithm's logic
3. Implement it from scratch
4. Analyze its time and space complexity
5. Practice with various problem variations

Remember, understanding the underlying principles of these algorithms is more important than memorizing their implementations. Focus on the problem-solving approach and how to apply these algorithms to different scenarios.
